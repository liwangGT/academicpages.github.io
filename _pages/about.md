I am a Staff Autopilot Planning and Controls Engineer at Tesla. I graduated from Georgia Tech in 2018 May with a Ph.D. degree in ECE supervised by Dr. [Magnus Egerstedt](http://magnus.ece.gatech.edu/index.html). My Ph.D. research interests lie in the intersection of <b>control theory</b>, <b>robotics</b>, and <b>machine learning</b>. More specifically, my Ph.D. research focuses on the provably safe collaboration of multiple robots (quadrotors and mobile robots), and safe learning based control techniques for robotics.
